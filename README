PXcjkcat package

A LaTeX package to provide LaTeX interface for manipulating the
CJK category code ('kcatcode') table of upTeX, which determines the
behavior of Unicode (non-ASCII) characters in source files.

1. Overview

The upTeX engine is an extention to the TeX engine and is developed by
Takuji TANAKA since 2007. This extension mainly aims in providing
better Unicode support to the pTeX engine, which has long been the
de facto standard of the TeX engine in Japan. The upTeX engine inherits
the basic architecture of pTeX, and only Japanese processing (which is
already on multi-byte basis in pTeX) is lift to the full Unicode range,
and non-Japanese processing remains on 8-bit basis (just like tra
original TeX engine). Thus one can typeset UTF-8 encoded documents that
contain all kinds of Unicode letters with use of upTeX accompanied with
the standard techniques for handling UTF-8 letters in the traditional
8-bit TeX engines (such as pdfTeX). The advantage of upTeX is the
ability of high-quality Japanese typesetting, which is fully inherited
from pTeX and is still lacking or at least on development in modern
Unicode-aware engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX.

Since upTeX could treat all the Unicode letters either as non-CJK or
CJK letter, it has the mechanism (called "kcatcode table") for
specifying which letters should be treated as CJK. The pxcjkcat package
provides a concise and user-friendly LaTeX interface to the mechanism.

2. Installation

In the distribution in conformance with TDS 1.1:

  - *.sty -> $TEXMF/tex/platex/PXcjkcat/

3. (Very) Basic Usage

Unfortunately the full-fledged manual comes only in Japanese. Here
the most basic usage is described.

If your document is mainly in English (or some other Western language)
and has sporadic occurrences of Japanese words/phrases, then put the
following lines in the preamble:

  \usepackage[prefernoncjk]{pxcjkcat}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % or utf8x if needed

If your document is mainly in Japanese, then put the following lines
in the preamble:

  \usepackage[prefercjkvar]{pxcjkcat}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % or utf8x if needed

The former setting treats the "CJK-ambiguous" punctuation symbols as
non-CJK letters, while the latter as CJK letters. Of course, your
document must in encoded in UTF-8.
